There is no doubt this job is tough especially watching elders make the same mistakes time and again, it's time to break the cycle and try new strategies in how we communicate and keep relationships with elected officials. It is important that I set a precedent in how I keep myself accountable with the support of my constituents and peers. I will always be transparent and upfront with my constituents so that they are in the loop and updated on what is going on. I will be truthful and open to any suggestions brought to me by other community members. \n        <br>\n        Linked here is our campaign’s <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/forms/feedback-form/\">feedback collection form</a>. If you ever see me going away from my values, please, hold me accountable, and help me grow.  \n        <br>\n        We must reimagine the relationship between our local governments and the communities they claim to serve. The government is supposed to work for the people, but it clearly is no’t. There have been too many times where critical decisions were made without the people’s input.</p>\n\n        <p><b>I am committed to creating structures that enable community members to hold me accountable for my actions. </b>First and foremost, accountability cannot happen without transparency, and so I will always strive to be upfront and honest with my District 4 community. I  hope to rely on that community to also call me in when they see me straying from my values. Read the accountability pledge that I took, and I hope you can sign our community accountability pledge as well saying you’ll hold me accountable.</p>\n\n        <p><b>We must reorganize and bolster the civic engagement cabinet.</b>The people of Boston should have more access to City Hall than they do now. As City Councilor, I would call for a reorganization and bolstering of the civic engagement cabinet so that they can act as a bridge between local government and the people.</p>\n            <ul class=\"sub-points\">\n                <li>Move the Mayor’s Youth Council (MYC)  from under the Health and Human Service cabinet to the Civic Engagement cabinet. This would allow for MYC to be in the same cabinet as Spark Boston, a counterpart of MYC but for millennials. Both of these councils aim to act as an advisory board for policymaking and community involvement. \n                </li>\n                <li>The Civic Engagement cabinet should also be responsible for hosting regular town hall meetings in every district to engage folks in conversation about current policy proposals and decisions being made.</li>\n                <li>The Civic Engagement cabinet should also be in charge of the city’s Youth Participatory Budgeting initiative, Youth Lead the Change  (currently housed under the Health and Human Services cabinet), and any future participatory budgeting initiatives.</li>\n            </ul>\n\n        <p><b>We must engage in a Participatory Budgeting process so that community members are engaged in the city’s budgeting process from start to finish.</b><a href=\"https://www.participatorybudgeting.org/\"> Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic process in which community members decide how to spend part of a public budget.
