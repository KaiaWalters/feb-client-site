Food abundance is security and safety in knowing you have access to healthy and nutritious food at home, school, and work. House-less people need access to healthy and nutritious food, undocumented folks need access to healthy and nutritious food, and incarcerated folks need access to healthy and nutritious food. The key to my plan is supporting policies and urban planning that bolster local food economies and free food programming while innovating more sustainable production systems.</p>\n            <ul class=\"main-points\">\n                <p><b>Urban Planning is essential to bring up when we talk about food.  </b>At the bare minimum, our neighborhoods should have food that is available and affordable.</p>\n                    <ul class=\"sub-points\">\n                        <li>We must protect small businesses from chain retailers. When large retailers move into our neighborhoods -- usually as a result of gentrification-- they take up business from local community shops and businesses. I support Zoning restrictions such as the <a href=\"https://northendwaterfront.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retail-Use-Zoning-amendment-revised-v5.pdf\">Retail Use Zoning Amendment</a>.</li>\n                        <li>We need to amend zoning and permit laws to allow for more flexible pop-ups to promote affordable fresh produce initiatives. We need more local farmer’s markets, <a href=\"https://www.aboutfresh.org/fresh-truck/\">Fresh Trucks</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/everyones-history/the-haymarket-project/\">reduced produce sellers</a> to provide their services throughout our streets, in vacant lands, and parking lots.</li>\n                        <li>Planting seeds for change in our community gardens, all year round. I want to propose additional grants to transform our community gardens into community greenhouses for the winter months. </li>\n                        <li>As a city councilor, I will advocate for more grants to fund more urban farms and  use vacant lots to create more open fence gardens. These grants will prioritize access for our youth and seniors. </li>\n                    </ul>\n                <p><b>We must build up strong local food economies that sustain the community, not corporate interests.</b> Remember the small Spanish grocery store? This is the answer to bringing food abundance into a reality.</p>\n                    <ul class=\"sup-points\">\n                        <li><a href=\"https://icic.org/blog/grocery-store-every-neighborhood/\"> We still have ways to go when it comes to food access.</a>I am prioritizing healthy, affordable options in our communities through the corner stores and small food businesses that exist. As a city councilor, I will support small food retailers in leveraging buying power to lower costs and increase access to healthy foods.</li>\n                        <li>As a city, we must do better to make healthy foods more accessible. While I support the initiative of food drop-offs at residentials we should also support invites that will bring food to our communities. Supporting the more non-profit grocers like Daily Table and supporting more city initiatives like the Double Up Food Bucks program.\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                <p><b>Free Food Programming</b></p>\n                    <ul class=\"sub-points\">\n                        <li>America is a global leader in food waste but Boston can lead in changing the way we talk about food waste. I will advocate for incentives for food providers to give free food to nontraditional programs that are popular providers of free food such as <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/food-insecurity-hunger/how-community-fridges-help-feed-america-freedges-public-refrigerators/\">community fridges</a>.</li>\n                        <li>As a city councilor, I will support additional grants for healthy food access initiatives like The Fresh Trucks and small cooperatives.</li>\n                        <li>We should be able to have more local farmer’s markets, Fresh Trucks, and other healthy food initiatives provide their services throughout our streets, in vacant lands, and parking lots. Our city needs to do a better job at providing permits to mini pop-ups of free healthy foods in vacant lands.</li>\n                    </ul>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n       name: 'FoodAbundance'\n    }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n@import \"/src/assets/css/main.css\";\n@import \"/src/assets/css/noscript.css\";\n.container {\n  color: #b70a0c;\n  padding: 25px; \n  padding: 1em;\n}\n#issues{\n  margin-top: 85px;\n}\n.major h2 {\n color: #b70a0c !important;\n}\n\n.major:after {\n  background: #b70a0c !important;\n}\np, b {\n  font-weight: bold !important;\n}\nul {\n margin-left: 20px;\n  width: 80%;\n}\na {\n  color: #b70a0c;\n}\n</style>"],"sourceRoot":"src/components"}]}
